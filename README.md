This is an attempt to forecast age-specific fertility rate (ASFR)
using Temporal Fusion Transformer (from Pytorch Forecasting),
with Ray serving as the orchestrator to parallelize tasks across
CPUs.

Merely a illustration of feasibility.  Not intended for public use,
since the pipeline is highly bespoke.

The input data module is redacted away for privacy/security.
